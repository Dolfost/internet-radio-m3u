# internet-radio-m3u

This is an collection of [extended m3u](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M3U)'s
files that describe radio stations.

I use it personally to listen to internet radio via
[Poweramp](https://powerampapp.com) android app.

In case of Poweramp, just clone this repository under the Poweramp search path.

Many of other players support m3u files, for example:
- mpv
- VLC
- Kodi
